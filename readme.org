collect-java-dump is a simple tool based [[https://github.com/jattach/jattach][jattach]] and [[https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-runtime-diagnostic-code-injection-java-platform-java-surgery][IBM Java Surgery]] to help generate
java threadump and heapdump for diagnozing java application problems.

* Supported JVMs

Currently, the following JVMs would be supported by this script:
- OpenJDK
- HotSpot
- OpenJ9
- IBM J9

* How to use

The ~jattach~ and the ~IBM Java Surgery~ have been packaged into the script so just
run the script giving the PID of the JVM or the WebSphere application server name.
