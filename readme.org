collect-java-dump is a simple tool based on [[https://github.com/jattach/jattach][jattach]] and [[https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/ibm-runtime-diagnostic-code-injection-java-platform-java-surgery][IBM Java Surgery]] to help generate
java threadump and heapdump for diagnozing java application problems.

* Why would you need this?

After all, there should be java on the host where the application was running and
you want to collect dumps, why would I need this?

Well, there're some situations you would like this script:
1. Only JRE installed on the machine where your java application's running and
   that means you cannot use the java tools to collect dumps because they're
   included in JDK. This situation is very common for a container environment.
2. There're a couple of different JDKs and the ways to collect dumps are
   different. You don't want to bother these.

* Supported JVMs

Currently, the following JVMs would be supported by this script:
- OpenJDK
- HotSpot
- OpenJ9
- IBM J9

* How to use

The ~jattach~ and the ~IBM Java Surgery~ have been packaged into the script so just
run the script giving the PID of the JVM or the WebSphere application server name.
For example:
#+begin_example
 my-collect-java-dump-any-production-dist-yyyymmddhhMMss.sh <PID of the JVM> | <WebSphere application server name>
#+end_example

* Note

Following must be noticed while using this script:
- This script must run with root or a user with sudo and no need to prompt password
- For WebSphere application server, the JDK must be above 8
- Heapdump may be very large, so it takes time for generating heapdump
